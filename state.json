However, this expansion has also provoked ethical concerns, such as privacy breaches, algorithmic discrimination, security and reliability issues, transparency, and other unintended consequences. To determine whether a global consensus exists regarding the ethical principles that should govern AI applications and to contribute to the formation of future regulations, this paper conducts a meta-analysis of 200 governance policies and ethical guidelines for AI usage published by public bodies, academic institutions, private companies, and civil society organizations worldwide. We identified at least 17 resonating principles prevalent in the policies and guidelines of our dataset, released as an open source database and tool. We present the limitations of performing a global-scale analysis study paired with a critical analysis of our findings, presenting areas of consensus that should be incorporated into future regulatory efforts.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue"

In the US, for example regions with higher adoption of new skills saw employment rise by 1.3 percent for each 1 percentage point increase in the share of job postings that require new skills over the past decade.\nHowever high-skill and low-skill workers tend to gain the most while middle-skill roles, like routine office jobs are being squeezed.\nThe picture for **AI-related skills** is even more complex. While these skills command wage premiums, they have not contributed to employment growth so far, like other new skills have. In fact, **employment levels in AI-vulnerable occupations** are lower in regions with high demand for AI skills\u2014 **3.6 percent lower after five years** than in regions with less demand for these skills. That\u2019s a challenge for young people starting their careers as entry-level jobs have higher exposure to AI.

As AI assumes greater responsibilities, the essential human touch in patient care might become less prevalent, potentially diminishing patient satisfaction and trust. [36]() Additionally, healthcare workers may feel marginalised by AI technology, concerned about job displacement or the devaluation of their professional skills. This concern is underscored by developments such as generative AI nurses, which operate at significantly lower costs compared with human nurses. [37]() Such cost efficiencies may pressure healthcare systems to view human workers as replaceable elements within AI-driven workflows. This is just one of many concerns that the deployment of AI could lead healthcare providers and institutions to prioritise financial efficiencies at the expense of meaningful improvements in patient care (ie, the pressure to streamline operations, reduce costs, and boost revenues might overshadow the potential of these technologies to enhance care quality or improve patient outcomes)."

While AI can enhance efficiency and personalize learning, over-reliance on it may compromise essential interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. As [Zhai et al. (2024)]() suggest, educational approaches should highlight the need to critically assess AI-generated content, compare it with insights from human sources, and recognize AI\u2019s limitations. They also emphasize that it is essential to promote reflection on the inherent biases in AI outputs and involving students in tasks that require thoughtful analysis and integration of information from varied sources can cultivate a more informed and discerning use of AI tools Moreover, safeguarding data privacy should be a priority to mitigate the anxiety associated with surveillance. Institutions should also address the potential job displacement issues by upskilling staff to work alongside AI rather than be replaced by it since as [Al-Zahrani (2024)]() points out, enhancements in AI transparency could simultaneously support teacher professional development and foster better student outcomes."

But while AI in its many forms has become ubiquitous and its benefits to society and the individual have grown, its impacts are varied. Concerns about its unintended effects and misuses have become paramount in conversations about the successful integration of AI in society. This volume explores the many facets of artificial intelligence: its technology, its potential futures, its effects on labor and the economy, its relationship with inequalities, its role in law and governance, its challenges to national security, and what it says about us as humans."

Humankind has to be industrious to make their living, but with the service of AI, we can just program the machine to do a thing for us without even lifting a tool. Human closeness will be gradually diminishing as AI will replace the need for people to meet face to face for idea exchange. AI will stand in between people as the personal gathering will no longer be needed for communication\nUnemployment is the next because many works will be replaced by machinery. Today, many automobile assembly lines have been filled with machineries and robots, forcing traditional workers to lose their jobs. Even in supermarket, the store clerks will not be needed anymore as the digital device can take over human labor\nWealth inequality will be created as the investors of AI will take up the major share of the earnings. The gap between the rich and the poor will be widened. The so-called \u201cM\u201d shape wealth distribution will be more obvious\nNew issues surface not only in a social sense but also in AI itself as the AI being trained and learned how to operate the given task can eventually take off to the stage that human has no control, thus creating un-anticipated problems and consequences."

Workers in sectors such as manufacturing, clerical work, and low-skill services are especially vulnerable, as AI systems become more capable of performing structured, rule-based tasks efficiently and at scale. This can lead to significant job losses or restructuring, particularly for workers with limited digital or adaptive skills.

Various national and international policies, regulations, and guidelines aim to address this issue, and several organizations have developed frameworks detailing the principles of responsible AI. Nevertheless, the understanding of how such principles can be operationalized in designing, executing, monitoring, and evaluating AI applications is limited. The literature is disparate and lacks cohesion, clarity, and, in some cases, depth. Subsequently, this scoping review aims to synthesize and critically reflect on the research on responsible AI. Based on this synthesis, we developed a conceptual framework for responsible AI governance (defined through structural, relational, and procedural practices), its antecedents, and its effects. The framework serves as the foundation for developing an agenda for future research and critically reflects on the notion of responsible AI governance.\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue"

(Source: https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2026/01/14/new-skills-and-ai-are-reshaping-the-future-of-work)\n* Regions with high AI skill demand saw employment declines in AI-vulnerable occupations by 3.6% over five years, indicating disruption at entry levels. (Source: https://www.imf.org/en/blogs/articles/2026/01/14/new-skills-and-ai-are-reshaping-the-future-of-work)\n* Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are reshaping job roles and creating wide public awareness of AI capabilities and impacts on employment. (Source: https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2025/article/incorporating-ai-impacts-in-bls-employment-projections.htm)\n\n## Ethical, Legal and Governance Issues\n\n* AI systems must be governed by frameworks addressing bias, discrimination, transparency, privacy, and ethical use to ensure societal trust and fairness. (Sources: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949697724000055, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389923002416)\n* State-level regulations in the U.S. like the Colorado AI Act aim to prevent algorithmic discrimination in critical areas including healthcare and recruitment. (Source: https://www.ai21.com/knowledge/ai-governance-frameworks/)\n* Institutionalizing ethical AI frameworks is crucial for responsible AI adoption across organizations. (Source: https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/blog/building-a-responsible-ai-framework-5-key-principles-for-organizations/)\n\n## AI's Broader Social Applications and Benefits\n\n* AI technologies are applied to address societal challenges in healthcare, education, climate, and economic opportunity with partnerships focusing on underserved communities.
